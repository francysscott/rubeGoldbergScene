Creates a room with a ball, umbrella, table with lathed legs, balls, slides, wooden 
blocks, teapot, and a window with the sounds and view of a rainy day.  There are also a 
number of objects including a set of shelves with small collectible items displayed.  
Someone has arranged the balls, slides and wooden blocks so that they form a sort of 
 simple Rube Goldberg device, ready to go. (Note: Textures make take a little 
while to properly load and render.)

Manipulate the sceneParams to change the scene's details.
Details available to change:
	room's size;
	wall, ceiling, and floor textures;
	window's width and frame color;
	ball's color, radius, shininess, and specular light interactions;
	table's height, width, color, texture, and shininess;
	umbrella canopy's color, size, texture, shininess, and specular light interactions;
	umbrella handle's color;
	teapot's size, shininess, and ambient, diffuse, and specular light interactions;
	slide's height, length, color and lighting;
	ramp's height, length, color and lighting;
	small marble's size, color and animation parameters;
	large marble's size, color and animation parameters;
	ambient light's color;
	and directional light's color.

	  <h2>Project Description:</h2>
	  <p>This project is part of the CS304 course at Wellesley 
	  College, Fall 2014.  It shows a lovely room with a window showing a rainy day 
	  outside. Inside the room there are a number of objects including an umbrella, table, 
	  several balls and slides, and a set of shelves with small collectible items displayed.  
	  Someone has arranged the balls, slides and wooden blocks so that they form a sort of 
	  simple Rube Goldberg device, ready to go. </p>
	  
	  <h2>How it Works</h2>
	  <p>This scene is written entirely in Javascript and utilizes the Threejs libraries 
	  available online at http://threejs.org/.  </p>
	  <h3>Project Structure</h3>
	  <p>This project has a main (contained within this file), a drawScene file that 
	  creates and places individual objects.  The main contains all the basic code for beginning 
	  a project of this type, such as the setup and camera, as well as the lighting and 
	  animation (because drawScene can't calculate the change in position for the 
	  animated objects).  The main also has a large dictionary that stores all the important 
	  data about each object in the scene especially user specifications such as color and 
	  size preferences.  The drawScene function takes the sceneParams and builds each object 
	  as specified, placing the objects into their correct locations.  It calls on the 
	  create function for each individual object file.  Each create() function returns a 
	  complete object mesh, ready to place in the scene.</p>
	  
	  <h2>Details to Notice</h2>
	  <h3>Interesting Geometries: Lathing, Extrusion, Bezier curves</h3>
	  <p>We used lathing to build a number of objects including the globes of the 
	  chandelier and the legs of the table.  However, the umbrella in the front left 
	  corner of the room really demonstrates the clever use of the principle. While many 
	  use lathing to make a seemingly smooth curve around the axis (as we did for the 
	  table legs and the glass chandelier globes), this object is made of a lathe of 8 
	  sides (an intentionally small number of sides for such a large object, and under 
	  other circumstances considered too crude for a proper lathing) to effectively and 
	  efficiently build the geometry of its canopy.  To emphasize the elegant nature of 
	  this design choice, Susie texture mapped the object to a striped picture so that it  
	  stands out as a very cheerful umbrella.  The umbrella is finished with a lovely 
	  cylindrical handle, torus for the hook and hemisphere to round off the edge of 
	  the hook. </p>
	  <img src="../images/ScreenShot2014-12-13at22510PM.png" alt="close up of umbrella and handle">
	  
	  <p>There are also some curves courtesy of sin functions built into the chandelier.</p>
	  <img src="../images/ScreenShot2014-12-16at102001AM.png" alt="close up of chadelier curve">
	  
	  <p>We also use extrusions to build the little yellow slide and larger orange ramp in
	  the scene.  The user can select whether she wants a lip on the each side of the 
	  slide when creating the object.  (Technically the tubes used for the chandelier arms 
	  are also extrusions, but the slides demonstrate extrusion of an unusual 2D shape.)</p>
	  <img src="../images/ScreenShot2014-12-16at103631AM.png" alt="close up of yello slide">
	  
	  
	  <h3>Material, Texture and Lighting</h3>
	  <p>As mentioned above, the umbrella has a lovely striped pattern.  We also applied 
	  texture mapping to a number of other objects.  Below, you can see the delicate wood 
	  textures on the table, wooden blocks and hardwood floor as well as the 
	  wallpaper in the room.  </p>
	  <img src="../images/ScreenShot2014-12-15at73317PM.png" alt="close up of reflections in ball">
	  <p>As for lighting, we use multiple kinds in our scene.  All objects have their own 
	  values for ambient light, usually the color of the object.  In addition, there are 
	  two directional sources of light.  One is just to help even out the look of the room, but the other 
	  directional light is from the direction of the window.  It is a soft grey light to 
	  help sell the feeling of a rainy day.  Finally, the chandelier emits a soft spotlight
	  that can be seen when looking up at the ceiling of the scene. </p>
	  
	  
	  <h3>Transparencies</h3>
	  <p>The glass globes in the chandelier use transparency, as you can see below.  We 
	  had also originally planned to use a partially transparent marble for our animation, 
	  but in the end decided that a reflective marble was more visually interesting.  Here 
	  is a closeup of the chandelier. </p>
	  <img src="../images/ScreenShot2014-12-13at22412PM.png" alt="chandelier with lipped edge and four branches">
	  <p>And just to keep it interesting, see if you can find a second example of 
	  transparency.  We'll draw more attention to it in a few paragraphs in the 
	  Dependencies section.</p>
	  
	  <h3>Reflections</h3>
	  <p>Looking carefully, you can see that both the small marble and larger ball appear 
	  to be tinted metals -- that is, they are reflective of their surroundings but imbued 
	  with a base hue.  Here's a closeup of the larger ball where you can see in the 
	  reflection, from the left to right, the umbrella, window, chandelier, little yellow 
	  slide with green marble, series of wooden blocks and shelves with the teapot.  Take 
	  a look at the reflections during the animation, and you'll also see that the 
	  reflections adjust to mirror the ball's position in the room and the state of the 
	  video in the window. (You can watch the video through its reflection in the ball!)</p>
	  <img src="../images/ScreenShot2014-12-15at72524PM.png" alt="close up of reflections in ball">
	  
	  <h3>Animations</h3>
	  <p>We have several animations occurring throughout our work.  Most obvious are the 
	  balls on the table as they each travel down slides or ramps.</p>
	  <p>Additionally, we used texture mapping with an ogv file to build a window with a 
	  video of a rainy day.  Listen carefully when you start the animation and you can 
	  hear the rain!  The change in these stills is easiest to see when looking at the 
	  upper right corner of the window's left pane.</p>

	  <h3>Dependencies and Function Calls to Others' Work</h3>
	  <p>In an homage to the history of computer graphics, we uploaded and used an svg 
	  file with the original teapot's parameters to include it in the scene.  
	  Additionally, we referenced various other projects by other students of this course,
	   and included a number of items from the public "contrib" library to which all 
	   students donated some object.  You can see the teapot and the student 
	   contributions on the shelves of the room in the far right corner including a 
	   penguin, apple and rocket. Not all "contrib" files were written such that they 
	   could be easily called using just a quick function call, so in the end we did not 
	   reference every student project.  However, we did build a Snowglobe object that 
	   can take any of these objects as input parameters so that one can make a snowglobe 
	   out of it.  The globe is made of transparent glass material.</p>

	  <h2>Challenges and Tricks</h2>
	  <p> There were a number of challenges we solved, here listed in the order 
	  we tackled them: </p>
	  <h3>Functionality, Modularity, Customizability and Ease of Use</h3>
	    <p>There are several very important factors in our code that are not immediately 
	    visible when watching the final scene that are nonetheless very important to our 
	    project.  Without good design and coding practices, it would be difficult for 
	    others to use our objects or for us to reuse them in the future.</p>
	  	<p>When placing multiple objects within a scene, we recognize the 
	  	realities of how these objects interact with one another.  For example, in 
	  	the physical world, we place a teapot on a shelf rather than embedding it in the wood or
	  	levitating it in the air above.  In a similar fashion, the objects in the 
	  	computer-generated scene must appear to interact with each other naturally.  
	  	Towards this goal, we took 
	  	care that every object had a natural point of origin so that a person could 
	  	position said object into the scene in an intuitive way.  For example, the 
	  	chandelier's point of origin is the center of the topmost plane of the ceiling 
	  	mount, so that users can specify chandelier.position.y = heightOfRoom without 
	  	having to tweak the settings of the chandelier.  Although this objective is not as snazzy 
	  	as, for example, anti-aliasing, it makes a big difference in the usability of the 
	  	created object. </p>
	  	<p>Additionally, these objects are highly customizable to the user's wishes.  
	  	Every library call passes parameters for height and/or width, colors and textures.  
	  	For example, users can build a table using our libraries to have simple or complicated legs 
	  	and determine what textures they want.  With the chandelier, users can even specify 
	  	between several shapes of globe and number of branches.  For example, here the user 
	  	specifies a lipped globe and four branches, then changes her mind and creates 
	  	a spherical globe and five branches where the glass is red and the metal is silver.
	  	  The only differences here are the hex, integer and 
	  	boolean values she fed in as parameters to the function call.  </p>

	    <img src="../images/ScreenShot2014-12-18at61157PM.png" alt="red chandelier with spherical edge and five branches">
	  
	    <p>Finally, we have some error-checking and exception handling that prevents 
	    unwary users from accidentally breaking the build of their object.  In some cases, this means 
	    capping a maximum or minimum value (such as number of branches for a chandelier).  
	    In other cases, this means specifying one parameter, such as width, as a constant 
	    proportion to another parameter, such as  
	    height, so that all the individual parts of the object fit together correctly. </p>
	  	<p>By making our contributions highly functional, intuitive and 
	  	customizable, we have provided objects that are useful and extensible to ourselves
	  	and anyone else interested in our designs.</p>
	  	
	  <h3>Curves</h3>
	  <p>We originally thought that we were going to use Bezier surfaces for the umbrella, 
	  but upon careful reflection we decided that lathing provided a cleaner look.  We did 
	  end up using a sine curve to extrude the tubular arms of the chandelier.  This 
	  presented a bit of a challenge because the sin curve generator we used would break if the
	  user input certain values for the height of the chandelier.  In response, we wrote a 
	  few lines of code that checked for this possibility, and slightly shrunk the size of 
	  the chandelier if necessary.  (This did not affect the overall object's ease of 
	  placement because the size was adjusted before the pieces were added to the object.  
	  So, the chandelier still remains firmly attached to the ceiling.)</p>
	  
	  <h3>Reflecting Surfaces</h3>
	  <p>Reflecting surfaces present a major challenge because they require the use of a 
	  cube camera located at the origin of the object in order to map the rays of light that 
	  would bounce off the reflective surface.  Having mapped the input, the camera then 
	  maps that view onto the surface of the sphere.  Harder still, javascript requires that 
	  any function must only return one thing but, in order to reflect, the function 
	  must return two things:  the object, and the camera within.  We solved this by placing 
	  the two items into an array of size 2 and then returning the array.   </p>
	  <p>This problem also complicates movement of any reflective object, a subject which we 
	  will discuss below under Animation - Translation and Rotation. </p>
	  	
	  <h3>Video Animation</h3>
	  <p>Making the video in theory is simple, but its implementation required careful attention 
	  to several crucial details.  In theory, one could substitute a jpg file with a 
	  video file and map it onto a given surface.  However, video mapping requires video 
	  files of only the type ogv.  Also, to minimize processing time, the video should not 
	  be too large.  Finally, unless the video is handled as an animation and "run" elsewhere 
	  in the page, the video will not run the appropriate place.  We solved these challenges 
	  by finding an appropriate file we liked and converting it to ogv format, shortening its 
	  length to two minutes.  Then, to solve the runtime issue, we initially ran the video 
	  at the bottom of the page in addition to the spot in our scene, but the video we ran 
	  below was purposefully hidden from the user's view so that it didn't appear.  Later 
	  on, when we implemented the other animations, this solved the need to run the video 
	  animation under the scene and so this code was removed. </p>

	  <h3>Animation - Translation and Rotation</h3>
	  <p>There are some very tough aspects of translating or rotating an object in three 
	  dimensions, particularly when the object needs to be precisely translated.  The balls 
	  rolling down the ramps are a particular challenge because it seems the compiler wants 
	  to add delta t of 0.00999999999999999 for every step instead of adding 0.01.  (We think 
	  this is a result of the way that the machine stores fractions in memory.)  This 
	  seemingly slight rounding error actually affects the ball's y position so strongly 
	  that the ball falls through the slide's bottom.</p>
	  <p>Translation of reflective objects are doubly complicated because the inner cube 
	  camera located inside the object must also move and record new images to map.  
	  Otherwise, the ball moves but its reflections remain static.  Once this problem is 
	  recognized, the simple solution is to translate the camera in tempo with the object.</p>
	  
	  <h3>Incorporating Others' Work</h3>
	  <p> We tried to use other students' contrib files to decorate the shelves of our 
	  scene, but some of the contrib files require more than just a function call.  Since 
	  the focus of this final project is to create new content, we decided to focus on our 
	  objects and new animation content.</p>
