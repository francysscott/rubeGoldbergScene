Update the description below

Creates a room with a a ball, umbrella, table with lathed legs, teapot, and a window
with the sounds and view of a rainy day. (Note: Textures make take a little 
while to properly load and render.)

Manipulate the sceneParams to change the scene's details.
Details available to change:
	room's size;
	wall, ceiling, and floor textures;
	window's width and frame color;
	ball's color, radius, shininess, and specular light interactions;
	table's height, width, color, texture, and shininess;
	umbrella canopy's color, size, texture, shininess, and specular light interactions;
	umbrella handle's color;
	teapot's size, shininess, and ambient, diffuse, and specular light interactions;
	slide's height, length, color and lighting;
	ramp's height, length, color and lighting;
	marble's size, color and animation parameters;
	ambient light's color;
	and directional light's color.

	<h1>CS307 Final Project:  Rube Goldberg Scene</h1>

	<p>Include writeup here.  Do we want some CSS on this page??</p>
	<p>Note:  all our screenshots should have the same filepath as our textures:
	  "../images/example.png"  so that we can keep all our images together 
	  easily in one spot.</p>
	  
	  <h2>Project Description:</h2>
	  <p>This project is part of the CS304 course at Wellesley 
	  College, Fall 2014.  </p>
	  
	  <h2>How it Works</h2>
	  <p>Uses Threejs</p>
	  <h3>Project Structure</h3>
	  <h3>Individual Objects</h3>
	  <h3>Object Placement and Interaction</h3>
	  
	  <h2>Details to Notice</h2>
	  <h3>Interesting Geometries: Lathing, Extrusion, Bezier curves</h3>
	  <p>We used lathing to build a number of objects including the globes of the 
	  chandelier and the legs of the table.  However, the umbrella in the front left 
	  corner of the room really demonstrates the clever use of the principle. While many 
	  use lathing to make a seemingly smooth curve around the axis (as we did for the 
	  table legs and the glass chandelier globes), this object is made of a lathe of 8 
	  sides (an intentionally small number of sides for such a large object, and under 
	  other circumstances considered too crude for a proper lathing) to effectively and 
	  efficiently build the geometry of its canopy.  To emphasize the elegant nature of 
	  this design choice, Susie texture mapped the object to a striped picture so that it really 
	  stands out as a very cheerful umbrella.  The umbrella is finished with a lovely 
	  cylindrical handle, torus for the hook and hemisphere to round off the edge of 
	  the hook. </p>

	  <h3>Material and Texture</h3>
	  <h3>Transparencies</h3>
	  <h3>Reflections</h3>
	  <h3>Animations</h3>
	  <h3>Dependencies and Function Calls to Others' Work</h3>
	  <p>In an homage to the history of computer graphics, we uploaded and used an svg 
	  file with the original teapot's parameters to include it in the scene.  
	  Additionally, we referenced various other projects by other students of this course,
	   and included a number of items from the public "contrib" library to which all 
	   students donated some object.  You can see the teapot and the student 
	   contributions on the shelves of the room in the far right corner including a 
	   penguin, apple and rocket. Not all "contrib" files were written such that they 
	   could be easily called using just a quick function call, so in the end we did not 
	   reference every student project as originally planned.</p>

	  <h2>Challenges and Tricks</h2>
	  <p> There were a number of challenges we solved, here listed in the order 
	  we tackled them: </p>
	  <h3>Functionality, Modularity, Customizability and Ease of Use</h3>
	    <p>There are several very important factors in our code that are not immediately 
	    visible when watching the final scene that are nonetheless very important to our 
	    project.  Without good design and coding practices, it would be difficult for 
	    others to use our objects or for us to reuse them in the future.</p>
	  	<p>When placing multiple objects within a scene, we recognize the 
	  	realities of how these objects interact with one another.  For example, in 
	  	the physical world, we place a teapot on a shelf rather than embedding it in the wood or
	  	levitating it in the air above.  In a similar fashion, the objects in the 
	  	computer-generated scene must appear to interact with each other naturally.  
	  	Towards this goal, we took 
	  	care that every object had a natural point of origin so that a person could 
	  	position said object into the scene in an intuitive way.  For example, the 
	  	chandelier's point of origin is the center of the topmost plane of the ceiling 
	  	mount, so that users can specify chandelier.position.y = heightOfRoom without 
	  	having to wrestle with the chandelier.  Although this objective is not as snazzy 
	  	as, for example, anti-aliasing, it makes a big difference in the usability of the 
	  	created object. </p>
	  	<p>Additionally, these objects are highly customizable to the user's wishes.  
	  	Every library call passes parameters for height and/or width, colors and textures.  
	  	Users can build a table using our libraries to have simple or complicated legs 
	  	and determine what textures they want.  With the chandelier, users can even specify 
	  	between several shapes of globe and number of branches.  For example, here the user 
	  	first specifies a lipped globe and four branches, then changes her mind and creates 
	  	a spherical globe and five branches:</p>
