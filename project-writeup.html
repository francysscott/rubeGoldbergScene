	<p>Note:  all our screenshots should have the same filepath as our textures:

	  <h2>Project Description:</h2>
	  <p>This project is part of the CS304 course at Wellesley 
	  College, Fall 2014.  </p>
	  
	  <h2>How it Works</h2>
	  <p>Uses Threejs</p>
	  <h3>Project Structure</h3>
	  <h3>Individual Objects</h3>
	  <h3>Object Placement and Interaction</h3>
	  
	  <h2>Details to Notice</h2>
	  <h3>Interesting Geometries: Lathing, Extrusion, Bezier curves</h3>
	  <p>We used lathing to build a number of objects including the globes of the 
	  chandelier and the legs of the table.  However, the umbrella in the front left 
	  corner of the room really demonstrates the clever use of the principle. While many 
	  use lathing to make a seemingly smooth curve around the axis (as we did for the 
	  table legs and the glass chandelier globes), this object is made of a lathe of 8 
	  sides (an intentionally small number of sides for such a large object, and under 
	  other circumstances considered too crude for a proper lathing) to effectively and 
	  efficiently build the geometry of its canopy.  To emphasize the elegant nature of 
	  this design choice, Susie texture mapped the object to a striped picture so that it really 
	  stands out as a very cheerful umbrella.  The umbrella is finished with a lovely 
	  cylindrical handle, torus for the hook and hemisphere to round off the edge of 
	  the hook. </p>

	  <h3>Material and Texture</h3>
	  <p>As mentioned above, the umbrella has a lovely striped pattern.  We also applied 
	  texture mapping to a number of other objects.  Below, you can see the delicate wood 
	  textures on the table, wooden blocks and hardwood floor as well as the 
	  wallpaper in the room.  </p>

	  <h3>Transparencies</h3>
	  <p>The glass globes in the chandelier use transparency, as you can see below.  We 
	  had also originally planned to use a partially transparent marble for our animation, 
	  but in the end decided that a reflective marble was more visually interesting.  Here 
	  is a closeup of the chandelier. </p>
	  <img src="../images/ScreenShot2014-12-13at22412PM.png" alt="chandelier with lipped edge and four branches">
	  
	  <h3>Reflections</h3>
	  <p>Looking carefully, you can see that both the small marble and larger ball appear 
	  to be tinted metals -- that is, they are reflective of their surroundings but imbued 
	  with a base hue.  Here's a closeup of the larger ball where you can see in the 
	  reflection, from the left to right, the umbrella, window, chandelier, little yellow 
	  slide with green marble, series of wooden blocks and shelves with the teapot.  Take 
	  a look at the reflections during the animation, and you'll also see that the 
	  reflections adjust to mirror the ball's position in the room and the state of the 
	  video in the window. (You can watch the video through its reflection in the ball!)</p>

	  <h3>Animations</h3>
	  <p>We have several animations occurring throughout our work.  Most obvious are the 
	  balls on the table as they each travel down slides or ramps.</p>
	  <p>Additionally, we used texture mapping with an ogv file to build a window with a 
	  video of a rainy day.  Listen carefully when you start the animation and you can 
	  hear the rain!  The change in these stills is easiest to see when looking at the 
	  upper right corner of the window's left pane.</p>

	  <h3>Dependencies and Function Calls to Others' Work</h3>
	  <p>In an homage to the history of computer graphics, we uploaded and used an svg 
	  file with the original teapot's parameters to include it in the scene.  
	  Additionally, we referenced various other projects by other students of this course,
	   and included a number of items from the public "contrib" library to which all 
	   students donated some object.  You can see the teapot and the student 
	   contributions on the shelves of the room in the far right corner including a 
	   penguin, apple and rocket. Not all "contrib" files were written such that they 
	   could be easily called using just a quick function call, so in the end we did not 
	   reference every student project.</p>

	  <h2>Challenges and Tricks</h2>
	  <p> There were a number of challenges we solved, here listed in the order 
	  we tackled them: </p>
	  <h3>Functionality, Modularity, Customizability and Ease of Use</h3>
	    <p>There are several very important factors in our code that are not immediately 
	    visible when watching the final scene that are nonetheless very important to our 
	    project.  Without good design and coding practices, it would be difficult for 
	    others to use our objects or for us to reuse them in the future.</p>
	  	<p>When placing multiple objects within a scene, we recognize the 
	  	realities of how these objects interact with one another.  For example, in 
	  	the physical world, we place a teapot on a shelf rather than embedding it in the wood or
	  	levitating it in the air above.  In a similar fashion, the objects in the 
	  	computer-generated scene must appear to interact with each other naturally.  
	  	Towards this goal, we took 
	  	care that every object had a natural point of origin so that a person could 
	  	position said object into the scene in an intuitive way.  For example, the 
	  	chandelier's point of origin is the center of the topmost plane of the ceiling 
	  	mount, so that users can specify chandelier.position.y = heightOfRoom without 
	  	having to tweak the settings of the chandelier.  Although this objective is not as snazzy 
	  	as, for example, anti-aliasing, it makes a big difference in the usability of the 
	  	created object. </p>
	  	<p>Additionally, these objects are highly customizable to the user's wishes.  
	  	Every library call passes parameters for height and/or width, colors and textures.  
	  	For example, users can build a table using our libraries to have simple or complicated legs 
	  	and determine what textures they want.  With the chandelier, users can even specify 
	  	between several shapes of globe and number of branches.  For example, here the user 
	  	specifies a lipped globe and four branches, then changes her mind and creates 
	  	a spherical globe and five branches.  The only difference here is the integers and 
	  	boolean values she fed into the signature.  The colors of both the globe and the arm
	  	are likewise easily adjustable.</p>
	  	<img src="../images/ScreenShot2014-12-13at22412PM.png" alt="chandelier with lipped edge and four branches">
	    <img src="../images/ScreenShot2014-12-13at25108PM.png" alt="chandelier with spherical edge and five branches">
	  
	    <p>Finally, we have some error-checking and exception handling that prevents 
	    unwary users from accidentally breaking the build of their object.  In some cases, this means 
	    capping a maximum or minimum value (such as number of branches for a chandelier).  
	    In other cases, this means specifying one parameter, such as width, as a constant 
	    proportion to another parameter, such as  
	    height, so that all the individual parts of the object fit together correctly. </p>
	  	<p>By making our contributions highly functional, intuitive and 
	  	customizable, we have provided objects that are useful and extensible to ourselves
	  	and anyone else interested in our designs.</p>
	  	
	  <h3>Video Animation</h3>
	  <p></p>
	  <h3>Bezier Curves</h3>
	  <p></p>
	  <h3>Reflecting Surfaces</h3>
	  <p></p>
	  <h3>Animation</h3>
	  <p>There are some very tough aspects of translating or rotating an object in three 
	  dimensions, particularly when the object needs to be precisely translated.  The balls 
	  rolling down the ramps are a particular challenge because it seems the compiler wants 
	  to add delta t of 0.00999999999999999 for every step instead of adding 0.01.  (We think 
	  this is a result of the way that the machine stores fractions in memory.)  This 
	  seemingly slight rounding error actually affects the ball's y position so strongly 
	  that the ball falls through the slide's bottom.</p>
